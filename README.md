<h1> Task for Java developer job</h1>
<h2>How to launch</h2>
This project was builded with Maven so for correct launch I add to pom.xml name of the "main" class. In this project main class is Parser.java.
For launch project you should go to target repository where you can find .jar file of project. You should write: __java -jar unoSoftTask-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar (your text file)__

Here is the example: java -jar unoSoftTask-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar lng.txt 

For add a memory limit you can write like that: __java -Xmx1G -jar unoSoftTask-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar (your text file)__

This program will count, group and output data from your txt file
